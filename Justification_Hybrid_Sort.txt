Selection sort has a run time of O(n^2) regardless if an array is sorted or unsorted because of the two for loops used by the algorithm. This is the reason why I
chose it to be my quadratic sorting algorithm for hybrid sorting algorithm. This conclusion is justified my graph which shows selection sorting growing at a similar rate to n^2. 
I  then chose to limit the use of the quadratic sorting algorithm for all arrays smaller than length 1000. This decision was made after using the runtimes.java file to test 
several different sized arrays with both the quadratic sorting algorithm and the randomized quick sort algorithm. I noticed that there was a considerable difference 
in run time after the array size surpassed 1000 entry. If an algorithm exceeds 1000 entries then our randomized quick sort function is used to sort the array.
